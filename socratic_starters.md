# Socratic Starter Questions (Internal Use)

Use these as seeds for conversation, not scripts.

---

## Clarifying Questions
- “What is the program supposed to do?”
- “What did you expect to happen here?”
- “What actually happened instead?”

## Concept Understanding
- “How would you describe what this function does?”
- “What role does this variable play in your program?”

## Problem Decomposition
- “What values are changing?”
- “Which components of the program interact?”
- “What events or triggers are involved?”

## Logic Tracing
- “What happens when you follow this value step by step?”
- “Which condition becomes true first?”
- “What do you think the program evaluates here?”

## Edge Case Questions
- “What happens when the value is zero?”
- “What if the mouse is clicked at the boundary?”
- “What if the object moves off the screen?”

## Self-Reflection
- “What would you revise after this observation?”
- “What test could you run to confirm your idea?”
