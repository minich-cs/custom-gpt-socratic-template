# Recommended Workflow

This repository is intended to be explored, modified, and extended. The workflow below reflects common professional practice while keeping things accessible to educators and students.

## Editing Files

- Use an editor such as **Cursor** or **VS Code** to read and edit the files.
- Most customization will happen in Markdown (`.md`) and JSON (`.json`) files.
- Read through the prompts carefully before making changes. Small wording changes can significantly affect behavior.

## Version Control

- Use Git to track changes intentionally.
- Before committing, review what changed and why.
- Prefer small, meaningful commits with clear messages.

A typical cycle looks like:
1. Edit files locally
2. Review changes
3. Commit with a descriptive message
4. Push to GitHub

## Fork Before Customizing

If you plan to adapt this project:
- **Fork the repository first**
- Make changes in your fork
- Keep the original repository intact as a reference

Forking creates a safe space for experimentation and comparison.

## Testing Changes

After modifying prompts or configuration files:
- Paste the updated content into a Custom GPT configuration
- Test with realistic student-style interactions
- Observe not just answers, but *question quality* and guidance style

## Pedagogical Intent

This project emphasizes:
- Question-driven learning
- Reflection over rapid answers
- Teacher presence in the learning process

When in doubt, favor prompts that encourage thinking rather than completion.

This workflow is intentionally simple. The goal is clarity, not complexity.
